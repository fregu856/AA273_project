SE-Sync is a certifiably correct algorithm for synchronization over the special Euclidean group, a common problem arising in the context of 2D and 3D geometric estimation (e.g. pose-graph SLAM and camera motion estimation).

We are making this software freely available in the hope that it will be useful to others.  If you use SE-Sync in your own work, please cite our papers:

==== Getting Started ====

To use the MATLAB implementation of SE-Sync, simply place the 'MATLAB' folder in any convenient (permanent) location, and then run the script MATLAB/import_SE_Sync.m.  Congrats!  SE-Sync is now ready to go :-).  For a minimal working example, see MATLAB/examples/main.m
